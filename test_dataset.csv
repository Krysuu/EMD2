"AHFS8CGWWXB5B","B00H1P4V3E","WASH ST. GAMER","[3, 4]","The Amazon Appstore free app of the day for June 9th, 2014 is Sudoku by Nikoli Easy 01 from Nikoli Co.As the others have mentioned in their reviews, this Sudoku version is at an average or below average quality.  It has nothing that sets it apart from the many other Android Sudoku apps out there.There was one particular gaming market though where this app and every other Sudoku app has failed to reach:  The Fire TV.  When Amazon announced the Fire TV about 2 months ago, Amazon and other developers were quick to point out how easy it was to make existing game apps compatible with the Fire TV.But after 2 months later after the release of Fire TV, we have several apps that are not very useful for the Fire TV such as a fireplace screensaver and a raindrops screensaver, but NOT a single Sudoku app for the Fire TV exists yet despite TVs and other streaming boxes that have a Sudoku game on them.  How could Amazon let an oversight like this happen?Had this app developer done their homework and made this app be the first Sudoku compatible app for the Fire TV, they might have gotten better reviews and stood out some from the many other Sudoku apps in Amazon's market.It appears our best hope for a Sudoku game to make it to the Fire TV without having to sideload one into the Fire TV is to wait for this ""Spring"" update Amazon has been mentioning forever in what seems to be the ""Longest Spring Ever"".Because of a huge missed opportunity of making this compatible with the Fire TV, that this only contains 20 easy puzzles, and because this app without Fire TV compatibility doesn't stand out from the many other tablet versions of Sudoku out there, I have no choice but to give this about 2 stars out of 5 stars.","Amazon Makes This ""Longest Spring Ever"" for Fire TV owners continue with this choice as Free App of The Day",1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2.0

Much easier to look at & more fun to play than many other Mahjong games for which I paid $10 or more.","Mahjong Premium",1394841600,"03 15, 2014",5.0

"AVG4YZ0ZV4F9X","B004Q6Y2LM","CDarbs","[0, 0]","Game ran fine on my Droid- noticed only a slight hiccup of a lag between rounds.  This type of game doesn't particularly interest me but it's cute and was executed well.  Some reviewers complained about the music- I can't speak to that myself as I had the volume on my phone turned down.  I'll be uninstalling this one as it's just not for me, but wanted to take a moment to leave a review.  Since there are many complaints of lag, force closes, reboots, etc., I thought leaving my technical gameplay experience with my particular phone may help the devs with future updates.","No gameplay problems, but not my cup of tea",1306368000,"05 26, 2011",3.0
